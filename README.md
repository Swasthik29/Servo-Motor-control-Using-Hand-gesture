# Servo-Motor-control-Using-Hand-gesture
In this Project which Include Mainly Three part 
  1.For controlling the servo motor only.
  2.Controlling Servomotor using only 2 finger tip of Hand and taking feedback as 5 leds.
  3.in privious 2 method it has disadvantage on it so we introduced new method using 5 finger and taking leds as feedback.
